# AI-Generated Hand Imagery: Enhancing Photorealism in MidJourney

This repository offers free and Creative Commons Zero licensed images I generated, showcasing examples of good hand generations. These images are realistic, non-posed, and use image references from my own professional photography gallery, taken with professional equipment, capturing candid and theatrical moments.

## The Problem with Hands

Generating photorealistic images of hands is a challenge for AI, including MidJourney's latest iterations. Professional photographs often used for training AI are posed, which can result in unnatural hand positions. Posing hands is a common workaround for photographers, but it doesn't reflect how hands are naturally seen in daily life.

I have a large collection of my own candid and theatrical photographs that provide more natural hand references. However, due to AI and copyright complexities (namely concerning the models in my photographs and the unknown with what the end images would be used for), I cannot share the original images on an open license. Instead, this GitHub repository will serve as a growing gallery of AI-generated images based on my original collections. These images will not resemble the original subjects but will maintain a realistic appearance, focusing particularly on hands.

## How Will Success Be Defined?

Success in this repository will be measured by the following criteria:

- Hands must have five fingers, or appear to have five if some are out of view.
- Allowance for some deviation from exact anatomical structure, within reason.

Some images may appear blurry as I experiment with soft focus to test photorealism with MidJourney.

## Thank You

Your interest in this project is greatly appreciated! If you find this repository useful or have suggestions for improvement, please consider giving it a star. Your support and feedback help drive the progress of this project. Also, please always feel free to use "style by Aimee Margaret" prompt in MidJourney as I try each version to add more photos using this prompt and I enjoy watching its evolution over time!
